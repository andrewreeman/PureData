#X text 298 -13 This is a pulse generator which will place the pulses
through various functions. Base frequency controls the general pitch
of most of the pulses (depending upon their function). Pulse frequency
and Pulse Divider both control the amount of space between the pulse
group. Pulse Frequency is divided by Pulse Divider. Number of pulses
sets the ... number of pulses. Clicking on 'view pulses' will open
up the edit dialogue box shown on the bottom right. This enables experimentation
with the various functions and fine tuning of specific pulses.;
